# PlankGrid

Every afternoon at [PlanGrid](https://plangrid.com/), this happens on chat...

> Reminder: **@here** PLANKTIME! :plank: :timer_clock:

...and shortly thereafter a small flashmob descends upon one of our open spaces.

**PlankGrid** _(n.)_ is a both a short exercise regimen to ground us (literally!) during our day and a cool group of people who are trying to stay fit.

Now it's an app, too! Since building extremely specific health timers has [recently been a pastime of mine](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/20twenty20), I took the opportunity for another learning project and built my first React Native app to help us through our current program:

1. _Standard Plank_ (55 seconds)
2. _Side Plank_ (35 seconds)
3. _Other-Side Plank_ (35 seconds)
4. _Wall Sits_ (55 seconds)

This is very much a first draft, but future plans include:

* [ ] Local notifications with sounds
* [ ] A customization screen for adding, removing, and reordering timers
* [ ] Better design
